# Points Calculator
This is a simple web application for calculating points in a game. Users can enter the names of players and their scores, and the application will calculate each player's total points and display them in a table. The application also supports saving and loading data from local storage, so users can continue their game even after closing their browser.

# Usage
To use the application, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser. Then, follow these steps:

1. Enter the names of players in the "Enter Player Names" form.
2. Enter the scores for each player in the "Enter Scores" form. Use commas to separate the scores, and use a dash ("-") to indicate a score that is the sum of all other players' scores.
3. Click the "Add Player" and "Add Scores" buttons to add the data to the table.
4. Use the "Reset Scores" button to clear the table and start a new game.
5. Use the "View History" button to view a history of previous games.
